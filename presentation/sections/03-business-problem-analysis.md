## The Business Problem

### Wind Forecast Errors Cost $47M Annually

- **Challenge**: 48-hour ahead wind forecasts have 15-20% RMSE
- **Impact**: Requires expensive fossil fuel backup generation
- **Opportunity**: 10% accuracy improvement = $4.7M savings + 50,000 tons CO2 reduction

### Grid Operations Context
- Supply must match demand instantaneously
- Forecast errors require spinning reserves
- Better forecasts enable higher renewable penetration

Note:
- Duration: 3 minutes
- Wind is inherently variable - this creates real operational challenges
- Current forecasting methods leave significant room for improvement
- Every percentage point of accuracy improvement has measurable economic and environmental benefits
- This is not a theoretical problem - grid operators face this challenge daily

## The Modeling Process

</div>
<div style="flex: 1;">

### Our Approach
1. **Baseline Models**: Persistence, seasonal naive (RMSE: 18.5%)
2. **Machine Learning**: Random Forest, XGBoost (RMSE: 13.2%)
3. **Deep Learning**: LSTM with attention (RMSE: 11.8%)

**Result**: 36% improvement over baseline, exceeding 30% target

</div>
</div>

Note:
- Duration: 3.5 minutes
- The literature tells us that ensembles have the best performance in this scenario
- Started with simple baselines to establish performance floor
- ML models captured non-linear power curves effectively
- Deep learning models best captured temporal dependencies
- The goal here is demonstrating we understand the data science process
- Real value comes from how we deploy these models, which we'll cover next

The 36% improvement claim is based on RMSE reduction:

Baseline RMSE: 18.5% (persistence model)
Best Model RMSE: 11.8% (LSTM with attention)
RMSE Improvement: (18.5 - 11.8) / 18.5 × 100 = 36.2%

## Operational Risk Management

### Managing Uncertainty and Ensuring Robustness

- **Uncertainty Quantification**: Prediction intervals (P90/P10) to quantify forecast uncertainty and inform reserve planning
- **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time drift detection using statistical process control (SPC) to identify shifts in model accuracy
- **Failure Mode Analysis**: Identified edge cases (extreme weather, sensor outages) with fallback to baseline forecasts for graceful degradation
- **Validation Framework**: Out-of-time validation on 6-month holdout set; stress-tested under seasonal extremes and ramp events

*Effective risk management ensures forecasts remain reliable, actionable, and deliver sustained economic and environmental benefits.*

Note: Uncertainty Quantification (Prediction intervals: P90/P10)
Explanation: Prediction intervals (e.g., P90/P10) provide a probabilistic range within which actual wind power generation is expected to fall. For example, a P90 forecast indicates a 90% probability that actual generation will exceed this value.
Relevance: Grid operators rely on these intervals to determine the necessary level of spinning reserves. Accurate uncertainty quantification directly reduces operational costs and environmental impact by minimizing unnecessary fossil fuel backup generation.
2. Performance Monitoring (Real-time drift detection using SPC)
Explanation: Statistical Process Control (SPC) involves continuously monitoring model performance metrics (e.g., RMSE) to detect significant deviations or "drift" from expected accuracy levels.
Relevance: Wind forecasting models can degrade over time due to changing weather patterns, turbine aging, or sensor issues. Real-time drift detection ensures timely identification and correction of model performance issues, maintaining forecast reliability.
3. Failure Mode Analysis (Edge cases, fallback to baseline forecasts)
Explanation: Identifying potential failure scenarios (e.g., extreme weather events, sensor outages) and establishing fallback procedures (such as reverting to simpler baseline forecasts) ensures graceful degradation of forecasting capability.
Relevance: Wind power forecasting is susceptible to rare but impactful events. Having robust fallback strategies ensures grid stability and operational continuity even when advanced models fail.
4. Validation Framework (Out-of-time validation, stress-testing)
Explanation: Out-of-time validation involves evaluating model performance on data not used during training (e.g., a 6-month holdout set). Stress-testing assesses model robustness under extreme conditions, such as seasonal extremes or rapid ramp events.
Relevance: Wind power generation exhibits strong seasonal and temporal variability. Rigorous validation ensures models generalize well to future conditions, providing confidence in their operational deployment.

These components collectively ensure that wind power forecasts remain accurate, reliable, and actionable, directly supporting grid stability, economic efficiency, and environmental sustainability.

## Model Risks in Wind Power Forecasting

### Model Development Risks
- **Overfitting**: Model memorizes training patterns, fails on new data (R² drops 40% on holdout)
- **Underfitting**: Oversimplified models miss critical non-linearities in power curves

### Model Performance Risks
- **Covariate Shift**: Distribution of wind patterns changes between training and deployment
- **Concept Drift**: Fundamental relationships change (e.g., turbine upgrades alter power curves)
- **Temporal Degradation**: Model accuracy decays predictably over time without retraining

---

## Model Risk Mitigation Strategies
- **Cross-Validation**: Time-series aware CV with 6-month forward validation
- **Regularization**: L1/L2 penalties, dropout layers, early stopping
- **Ensemble Methods**: Combine diverse models to reduce individual model risk
- **Feature Engineering**: Physics-based constraints (power ≤ rated capacity)
- **Continuous Learning**: Automated retraining pipeline with performance triggers

**Model Risk Impact**: Unmitigated technical risks can degrade RMSE by 25-40% within 12 months

Note:
- Duration: 3 minutes
- Overfitting example: Complex deep learning model achieves 8% RMSE on training but 15% on test
- Covariate shift: Climate change alters wind patterns - models trained on 2010 data perform poorly by 2020
- Feature leakage: Including t+1 wind speed when predicting t+48 power
- Key message: Technical rigor in model development prevents costly failures in production
- Focus on reproducible, robust modeling
