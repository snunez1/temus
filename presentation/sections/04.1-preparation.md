## The Preparation
<center>Building Domain-Aware AI Agents</center>

Note:
- Duration: 10 seconds
- Subsection intro for The Preparation
- First step: preparing our AI agent with comprehensive domain knowledge

---

## Gathering Domain Knowledge

### Research Process
- **Literature Review**: 50+ papers on wind forecasting best practices
- **Industry Standards**: IEC 61400-12-1 for power curve modeling
- **Physical Principles**: Incorporated wind power physics (P = 0.5ρAv³)
- **Business Context**: Grid operations, market mechanisms, penalties

### Key Resources Compiled
- Power curve characteristics and cut-in/cut-out speeds
- Meteorological factors affecting generation
- Grid integration challenges and solutions
- Model evaluation metrics used by industry

Note:
- Duration: 2 minutes
- We didn't just build models - we first understood the domain deeply
- Compiled comprehensive documentation in supporting-references-modelling.md
- This knowledge base becomes the foundation for our AI agent
- Similar to how McKinsey consultants receive detailed briefings before engagements

## VS Code Integration

### Embedding Domain Knowledge

````yaml
# .github/prompts/wind-power-domain.prompt.md
- Wind power follows cubic relationship with wind speed
- Consider cut-in (3-4 m/s) and cut-out (25 m/s) speeds
- Account for wake effects in wind farm layouts
- Use industry-standard metrics (RMSE, MAE, capacity factor)
````

### Project-Specific Context
- Data dictionaries for all variables
- Business objectives and constraints
- Model deployment requirements
- Performance benchmarks from GEF2012

Note:
- Duration: 2.5 minutes
- Modified VS Code Copilot instructions to include domain expertise
- Agent now understands wind power physics, not just generic ML
- Provides consistent, informed suggestions aligned with industry practices
- This is like giving a consultant a detailed project briefing document

## Agent Briefing Results

### Before Domain Knowledge
```python
# Generic ML approach
model = RandomForestRegressor()
model.fit(X, y)
```

### After Domain Knowledge
```python
# Domain-aware approach
# Account for cubic power relationship
X['wind_speed_cubed'] = X['wind_speed'] ** 3

# Handle cut-in/cut-out thresholds
X['effective_wind'] = np.where(
    (X['wind_speed'] >= 3.5) & (X['wind_speed'] <= 25),
    X['wind_speed'], 0
)

# Site-specific power curves
model = RandomForestRegressor(
    min_samples_leaf=50  # Prevent overfitting to outliers
)
```

Note:
- Duration: 2.5 minutes
- Dramatic improvement in code quality and domain relevance
- Agent now suggests physics-based features automatically
- Handles edge cases like turbine cut-out during storms
- This preparation phase is critical for producing production-ready solutions
