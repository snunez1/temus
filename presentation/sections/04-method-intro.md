## Section Overview

### AI Agent Development Approach

1. **The Preparation** - Building domain-aware AI agents with comprehensive wind power knowledge
2. **The DSL** - Domain-specific language for structured wind forecasting
3. **The Agent** - MCP-powered natural language interface for accessible analytics

### Key Innovation
*Transforming complex wind forecasting models into accessible AI agents through systematic domain integration*

Note:
- Duration: 1 minute
- This section focuses on the technical implementation and deployment
- MCP is the key differentiator - makes forecasting models accessible to AI agents
- We'll show both the technical architecture and business integration
- Emphasis on production-ready, not just research-quality solutions
