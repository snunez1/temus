## The Agent
<center>MCP-Powered Natural Language Interface</center>

Note:
- Duration: 10 seconds
- Subsection intro for The Agent
- Finally, we built an intelligent agent to make forecasting accessible

## MCP Approach Selection

| Approach | Code Complexity | Flexibility | Performance |
|----------|-------------|------------|-------------|
| Approach 1: Tool Per Analysis | High | Low | Good |
| Approach 2: Dynamic Analysis | Medium | Medium | Good |
| **Approach 3: Prompt-Guided** | **None** | **High** | **Excellent** |

Note:
- Duration: 2.5 minutes
- Evaluated multiple integration approaches documented in design-choices.md
- Approach 3 provides best balance of power and usability
- No need to retrain staff on new tools
- Business users can directly query forecasts and insights

---

## Why Approach 3?
- Zero modifications to existing notebook code
- Natural language queries for business users
- Flexible analysis without predefined paths
- Maintains full analytical power

## MCP Tool Implementation

1. **Power Curve Analysis**: Turbine performance validation
2. **Forecast Evaluation**: RMSE, MAE by horizon and conditions
3. **Temporal Patterns**: Diurnal, seasonal trend detection
4. **Uncertainty Quantification**: Prediction intervals, risk metrics
5. **Business Impact**: Cost and CO2 calculations
6. **Model Comparison**: Architecture performance analysis
7. **Feature Importance**: Driver identification
8. **Error Diagnosis**: Root cause analysis of failures

Note:
- Duration: 2.5 minutes
- Each tool designed based on actual grid operator needs
- Referenced wind power forecasting journals for best practices
- Tools provide both technical metrics and business insights
- Can answer questions like "Why did forecasts fail during last week's storm?"

## Agent Capabilities Illustration

### Natural Language Queries
```
User: "What's causing high forecast errors for wind farm 3?"

Agent: Analyzing forecast performance for wf3...
- Identified 15% higher RMSE during hours 14-18
- Root cause: Thermal effects from nearby city
- Recommendation: Add temperature differential features
- Expected improvement: 3.2% RMSE reduction
```

### Business Impact Analysis
```
User: "Calculate CO2 savings if we improve accuracy by 10%"

Agent: Based on current operations:
- Reduced spinning reserves: 12 MW average
- Annual CO2 reduction: 52,000 tons
- Cost savings: $4.7M/year
- Equivalent to removing 11,000 cars
```

Note:
- Duration: 2 minutes
- Agent translates technical improvements to business outcomes
- Provides actionable insights, not just metrics
- Accessible to non-technical stakeholders
- Demonstrates clear path to value realization
