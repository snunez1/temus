## The DSL
<center>Domain-Specific Language for Wind Forecasting</center>

Note:
- Duration: 10 seconds
- Subsection intro for The DSL
- Next, we developed a specialized language for wind forecasting tasks

## DSL Design Principles

### Structure (to-be)
```
prompt-library/
├── analysis/
│   ├── power-curve-analysis.md
│   ├── temporal-patterns.md
│   └── forecast-evaluation.md
├── modeling/
│   ├── feature-engineering.md
│   ├── model-selection.md
│   └── hyperparameter-tuning.md
└── deployment/
    ├── mcp-service.md
    └── monitoring.md
```

### Key Components
- **Structured Prompts**: Consistent format for reproducibility
- **Domain Constraints**: Embedded physics and business rules
- **Quality Checks**: Automatic validation of outputs

Note:
- Duration: 2.5 minutes
- DSL provides structured way to interact with AI agent
- Each prompt template includes context, constraints, and expected outputs
- Ensures consistency across team members and analyses
- Similar to McKinsey's structured problem-solving frameworks

## DSL Benefits

### Efficiency Gains
- **Analysis Time**: 4 hours → 30 minutes
- **Code Quality**: fewer domain errors
- **Reproducibility**: consistent outputs

### Business Value
- Democratizes advanced analytics
- Reduces dependency on domain experts
- Enables rapid prototyping
- Facilitates knowledge transfer


Note:
- Duration: 2 minutes
- Quantifiable improvements in development efficiency
- New team members productive in days, not months
- Domain experts can focus on strategy, not implementation
- Creates institutional knowledge that persists beyond individual contributors
Justification: Without DSL, a data scientist would need to:

Research domain requirements (1-2 hours)
Write and debug code (1-2 hours)
Validate against standards (30 minutes)
Handle edge cases (30 minutes)

## DSL Architecture

<div style="text-align: center;">
<img src="assets/images/dsl-architecture.png" alt="DSL Architecture Diagram" style="width: 85%; height: auto; border: 1px solid #ccc; border-radius: 8px;">
</div>


Note:
- Duration: 3 minutes
- Architecture ensures consistent, high-quality outputs
- Each layer adds value: structure → validation → generation
- Similar to software engineering best practices: separation of concerns
- Enables scaling from individual analyses to enterprise deployment

## DSL in Action

### Example: EDA
```markdown
#file:".github/prompts/eda-workflow.prompt.md"
Please perform a systematic EDA on the GEF2012 wind dataset,
following the workflow in this file.
```
### Example: Model Development
```markdown
#file:".github/prompts/model-development.prompt.md"
Implement a Random Forest and XGBoost model for 48-hour wind power
forecasting. Compare their performance.
```

Note:
- Duration: 2.5 minutes
- DSL prompt automatically generates complete analysis notebook
- Includes all domain-specific considerations
- Output is production-ready, not just exploratory
- Agent handles edge cases that generic ML engineers might miss
