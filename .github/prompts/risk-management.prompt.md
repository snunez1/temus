# Model Risk Management Framework

Implement comprehensive risk management:

## 1. Model Validation
- Out-of-time validation on holdout period
- Stress testing on extreme weather events
- Performance degradation analysis
- Comparison with industry benchmarks

## 2. Uncertainty Quantification
```python
# Select method based on final model:
# - Tree ensembles → Use variance-based intervals
# - Neural networks → Use dropout-based uncertainty
# - Any model → Apply conformal prediction wrapper

# Implementation strategy:
uncertainty_method = select_method(model_type)
if uncertainty_method == "ensemble_variance":
    # For tree-based models (RF, XGBoost)
    predictions, intervals = model.predict_with_uncertainty(X_test)
elif uncertainty_method == "dropout_mc":
    # For neural networks (LSTM, Transformer)
    model.enable_dropout()
    predictions = np.mean([model.predict(X_test) for _ in range(100)], axis=0)
    intervals = np.percentile([model.predict(X_test) for _ in range(100)], [5, 95], axis=0)
elif uncertainty_method == "conformal":
    # Model-agnostic approach
    predictions = model.predict(X_test)
    intervals = conformal_prediction_intervals(model, X_calibration, y_calibration, X_test, alpha=0.1)
```

## 3. Monitoring Strategy
- Real-time performance tracking
- Data drift detection (PSI, KS statistics)
- Model drift alerts
- Automated retraining triggers

## 4. Failure Modes
1. **Data Quality Issues**
   - Missing forecast data → fallback models
   - Sensor failures → imputation strategies
   
2. **Model Failures**
   - Extrapolation beyond training → ensemble voting
   - Computational timeout → cached predictions

## 5. Business Continuity
- Model redundancy (primary/backup)
- Gradual rollout procedures
- Rollback mechanisms
- Performance SLAs
