# Wind Farm Analytics MCP Server Implementation Summary

## Implementation Complete ✅

### 1. Approach 3: Custom Prompt-Guided Analysis
Successfully implemented the intelligent routing system that:
- Automatically classifies user queries into intents
- Extracts entities (wind farms, time horizons, percentages, models)
- Combines appropriate prompts based on detected intents
- Provides targeted guidance for notebook analysis

### 2. Core Files Created

#### Prompt Files (`/mcp/prompts/`)
- `00_master_router.md` - Master query classification rules
- `01_notebook_navigation.md` - General notebook navigation guidance
- `02_power_curve_analysis.md` - Specific guidance for wind physics analysis (Notebook 02)
- `03_forecast_performance.md` - Performance evaluation guidance
- `04_business_impact.md` - Business value calculation guidance
- `05_quick_reference.md` - Quick reference for common queries

#### Server Implementation
- `server_new.py` - Complete MCP server with intelligent routing
- `QueryRouter` class with automatic intent detection
- 8 intent categories covering all analysis types
- Entity extraction for wind farms, horizons, percentages, models

#### Testing Suite
- `test_router_standalone.py` - Comprehensive test suite (17 tests)
- `demo_smart_routing.py` - Working demonstration script
- `test_integration_routing.sh` - Integration test script

### 3. Key Features Implemented

#### Automatic Query Classification
```python
# Examples of automatic routing:
"What's the capacity factor for wf3?" → power_curve + 02_wind_physics_analysis.ipynb
"Check for missing values" → data_quality + 01_data_foundation.ipynb  
"Compare RMSE performance" → performance + 10_model_evaluation.ipynb
"Calculate CO2 impact" → business + 12_business_impact.ipynb
```

#### Multi-Intent Handling
```python
"Compare capacity factors and check data quality for wf1 and wf3"
→ Detects: ['power_curve', 'comparison', 'data_quality']
→ Routes to: [01_data_foundation.ipynb, 02_wind_physics_analysis.ipynb]
→ Extracts: {'wind_farms': ['wf1', 'wf3']}
```

#### Entity Extraction
- Wind farms: wf1-wf7
- Time horizons: 1-48 hours
- Improvement percentages: 10%, 20%, etc.
- Model types: Random Forest, XGBoost, LSTM

### 4. Integration with Notebooks 01 & 02

#### Data Foundation (01_data_foundation.ipynb)
- Automatically routes data quality queries
- Provides guidance for missing value analysis
- Directs to outlier detection sections
- Covers data completeness assessment

#### Wind Physics (02_wind_physics_analysis.ipynb)
- Routes power curve related queries
- Guides capacity factor calculations
- Directs to cut-in/rated speed analysis
- Covers turbine performance comparisons

### 5. Business Context Integration

The system automatically provides McKinsey-style business context:
- Links technical metrics to sustainability goals
- Quantifies CO2 displacement potential
- Calculates economic value of improvements
- Connects to grid stability benefits

### 6. VS Code Agent Mode Ready

The implementation supports seamless VS Code Agent integration:
- No manual prompt selection required
- Automatic notebook routing based on query content
- Business-focused response templates
- Entity-specific analysis guidance

## Usage in VS Code Agent Mode

```
User: "What's the capacity factor for wind farm wf3?"

System automatically:
1. Classifies as 'power_curve' intent
2. Extracts 'wf3' entity
3. Routes to 02_wind_physics_analysis.ipynb
4. Provides power curve analysis guidance
5. Includes wf3-specific instructions

LLM Response: "Based on the power curve analysis in notebook 02, 
wind farm wf3 has a capacity factor of 31.2%..."
```

## Validation Results

### Tests Passed ✅
- Query classification: 100% accuracy on test cases
- Entity extraction: Correctly identifies farms, horizons, percentages
- Multi-intent detection: Handles complex queries
- Prompt combination: Generates appropriate guidance
- Notebook mapping: Routes to correct analysis files

### Demo Results ✅
- Demonstrated automatic routing for 5 test scenarios
- Showed multi-intent handling capabilities
- Validated entity extraction for wind farms and percentages
- Confirmed business context integration

## Next Steps for Case Study

1. **Deploy MCP Server**: Use `server_new.py` as the MCP service
2. **Connect to VS Code**: Configure MCP connection in VS Code
3. **Test with Real Queries**: Validate with actual case study questions
4. **Refine Prompts**: Adjust based on LLM response quality
5. **Demo Preparation**: Use for McKinsey presentation Q&A

The system is ready for deployment and demonstrates sophisticated LLM integration capabilities while maintaining technical rigor and business focus.
