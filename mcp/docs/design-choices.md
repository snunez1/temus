# Wind Farm Analytics MCP Server: Design Choices Comparison

## Overview

This document compares three approaches for enabling LLM analysis of wind farm data through Model Context Protocol (MCP) for the Temus case study. Each approach represents a different strategy for integrating existing notebook analyses with the MCP server.

---

## Approach 1: Direct Integration of Analysis Functions

### Architecture
Extract notebook code into reusable Python modules that the MCP server calls directly.

### Implementation Pattern
```python
# Extract from notebooks → Python modules → MCP tools
notebook_analysis.ipynb → src/analysis/power_curves.py → @mcp.tool()
```

### Advantages ✅
- **Real-time computation**: Analyses are performed on-demand with latest data
- **Parameter flexibility**: LLM can specify exact analysis parameters for each request
- **Single source of truth**: No duplicate logic between notebooks and MCP server
- **Memory efficient**: No need to store intermediate results
- **Dynamic insights**: Can explore data interactively based on conversation context

### Disadvantages ❌
- **Higher latency**: Complex analyses may take seconds to compute
- **Computational overhead**: Repeated analyses consume more resources
- **Code complexity**: Requires refactoring notebook code into production-ready modules
- **Dependency management**: MCP server needs all analysis libraries installed

### Best Use Case
Production systems with changing data that require real-time analysis capabilities.

## Approach 2: Pre-computed Results from `/data/processed`

### Architecture
Notebooks save analysis results to Parquet files; MCP server reads and serves these pre-computed results.

### Implementation Pattern
```python
# Notebooks → Parquet files → MCP tools
notebook.ipynb → data/processed/results.parquet → @mcp.tool()
```

### Advantages ✅
- **Ultra-low latency**: <50ms response times for most queries
- **Computational efficiency**: Complex analyses run once during batch processing
- **Separation of concerns**: Analysis logic stays in notebooks; MCP focuses on serving
- **Reliability**: Pre-computed results are always available
- **Version control**: Can track analysis results over time

### Disadvantages ❌
- **Static insights**: Limited to pre-computed analysis parameters
- **Storage overhead**: Requires disk space for intermediate results
- **Update lag**: Results only refresh when notebooks re-run
- **Limited exploration**: Cannot perform ad-hoc analyses

### Best Use Case
Demo scenarios and stable metrics that don't require real-time computation.

---

## Approach 3: Custom Prompt-Guided Analysis

### Architecture
Use custom prompt files (e.g., `.github/copilot-instructions.md`) to guide the LLM in analyzing notebooks directly, without modifying notebook code or pre-computing results.

### Implementation Pattern
```python
# Prompt guidance → Notebook analysis → LLM interpretation
prompt_file.md → read_notebook_cell() → LLM analysis
```

### Advantages ✅
- **Zero code changes required**: Notebooks remain completely unchanged
- **Leverages LLM's code understanding**: Utilizes natural language processing of code
- **Flexible interpretation of results**: Can explain methodology, not just results
- **Can explain methodology**: LLM understands the "why" behind analyses
- **Immediate implementation**: No refactoring or data processing needed

### Disadvantages ❌
- **Depends on LLM's ability to parse notebooks**: Quality varies with LLM sophistication
- **May miss complex calculations**: Could overlook nuanced analytical details
- **Results vary with LLM quality**: Consistency depends on model capabilities

### Best Use Case
**Case study demonstrations** and exploratory analysis where flexibility is paramount.

## Performance Comparison

| Metric | Direct Integration | Pre-computed | Prompt-Guided |
|--------|-------------------|--------------|---------------|
| **Response Time** | 100-500ms | <50ms | 200-1000ms |
| **Implementation Effort** | High | Low | Very Low |
| **Flexibility** | High | Low | Very High |
| **Reliability** | Medium | High | Medium |
| **Resource Usage** | High | Low | Medium |
| **Maintenance** | High | Low | Very Low |

2. **Demonstration Value**: Shows sophisticated LLM integration capabilities
3. **Flexibility**: Can answer unexpected questions during Q&A
4. **Narrative Power**: LLM can explain the "why" behind analyses
5. **Low Risk**: Notebooks remain unchanged and functional

#### Case Study Benefits
- ✅ Demonstrates ML expertise (through notebook analysis)
- ✅ Shows MCP deployment skills
- ✅ Enables real-time Q&A during presentation
- ✅ Maintains technical rigor
- ✅ Delivers business value focus

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Power Curve Analysis
```
User: "What's the capacity factor for wind farm wf3?"

MCP Response:
{
  "question": "capacity factor for wind farm wf3",
  "analysis_context": "Look for power curve analysis in notebooks. Focus on mean power output calculations...",
  "relevant_notebooks": ["02_power_curve_analysis.ipynb"],
  "guidance": "Find the capacity factor calculation for wf3"
}

LLM: "Based on the power curve analysis in notebook 2, wind farm wf3 has a capacity factor of 0.312, calculated from the mean normalized power output..."
```

### Example 2: Business Impact
```
User: "What's the CO2 impact of improving forecast accuracy by 20%?"

MCP Response:
{
  "analysis_context": "Use 0.5 tons CO2/MWh displacement factor. Calculate forecast error cost reduction...",
  "relevant_notebooks": ["04_model_evaluation.ipynb", "05_business_impact.ipynb"]
}

LLM: "A 20% improvement in forecast accuracy reduces grid balancing costs and increases renewable penetration, resulting in approximately 450 additional tons CO2 displaced annually per MW installed..."
```

## Technical Considerations

### Prompt Engineering Best Practices
```markdown
## Wind Farm Analysis Assistant Instructions

When analyzing wind farm data:

### 1. Locate Relevant Notebooks
- Power Curves: `/notebooks/02_power_curve_analysis.ipynb`
- Model Results: `/notebooks/04_model_evaluation.ipynb`
- Business Impact: `/notebooks/05_business_impact.ipynb`

### 2. Analysis Patterns
#### For Power Curve Analysis:
1. Look for `groupby(['WIND_FARM', 'wind_bin'])`
2. Find power curve visualization cells
3. Extract cut-in speeds, rated power, capacity factors

### 3. Response Format
- **Summary**: Key findings in 2-3 sentences
- **Details**: Specific metrics and values
- **Insights**: Business-relevant interpretations
```
