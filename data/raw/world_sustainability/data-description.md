## Dataset Description
A ‘global sustainability’ dataset has been put together for the TrueCue Women+Data Hackathon. The dataset tracks the performance of 173 countries against a range of sustainability metrics over a 19-year period.

The dataset was generated from several merged data sources. While there 54 fields included, participants are not expected, nor advised to analyse the whole data. On the contrary, the wide nature of the dataset should give rise to a range of analytical possibilities.

Please note that the data is real. This presents all the challenges of working with data in professional world, such as missing values. For instance, a given country may not have data available for every field and every year.

The data-dictionary.csv file in this directory contains the description of the data fields.
